# Simple suppression file for gcov. Each line is the name of the gcov file followed
# the corresponding number of uncovered lines that are expected. The coverage
# post-processing done by gcov.py compares the number of uncovered lines resported by gcov
# with the number of lines here. If they don't match, gcov.py complains and returns
# non-zero exit status.
#
# This is useful to stop senseless chatter from gcov about uncovered lines, particularly
# for unreachable error conditions, such as system call failure.

DaemonImpl.cpp.gcda##DaemonImpl.cpp.gcov 4                       # Unreachable system call failures
