Build dependencies
------------------

List of packages required to build and test the code:

- cmake (cmake, 2.8.10 with patch (see below) or later)
- gcovr (gcovr, 2.4-0ubuntu1 or later)
- lcov (lcov, 1.9-3 with patch (see below) or later)
- gtest (libgtest-dev, 1.6.0 or later)
- cppcheck (cppcheck, 1.55-1 or later)
- doxygen (doxygen, 1.8.1.2-1 or later)
- graphviz (graphviz, 2.26.3-12ubuntu1 or later)
- libboost (libboost1.49-dev or later)


Building the code
-----------------

The simplest case is:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

By default, the code is built in release mode. To build a debug version, use

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    $ make

or simply

    $ make debug               # or make release
    $ make

For a release version, use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release (or "make release; make").


Running the tests
-----------------

    $ make
    $ make test

Note that "make test" alone is dangerous because it does not rebuild
any tests if either the library or the test files themselves need
rebuilding. It's not possible to fix this with cmake because cmake cannot
add build dependencies to built-in targets. To make sure that everything
is up-to-date, run "make" before running "make test"!

To run the tests with valgrind:

    $ make valgrind

To run the coverage tests:

    $ make coverage

Note that, with gcc 4.7.2 and cmake 2.8.10, you get a bunch of
warnings. Until cmake fixes this problem, the second step of coverage
testing (which lists all files that have unexpected uncovered source
lines) does not happen.

As a work around, run the following command from the build directory
after running make coverage:

    $ ../test/gcov/gcov.py Testing/CoverageInfo/ ../test/gcov/expected

Alternatively, you can build cmake 2.8.10 with the following patch:

http://cmake.org/gitweb?p=cmake.git;a=commitdiff;h=61ace1df2616e472d056b302e4269cbf112fb020#patch1

Unfortunately, it is not possibly to get 100% coverage for some files,
mainly due to gcc's generation of two destructors for dynamic and non-
dynamic instances. For abstract base classes and for classes that
prevent stack and static allocation, this causes one of the destructors
to be reported as uncovered.

There are also issues with some functions in header files that are
incorrectly reported as uncovered due to inlining, as well as
the impossibility of covering defensive assert(false) statements,
such as an assert in the default branch of a switch, where the
switch is meant to handle all possible cases explicitly.

If you run a binary and get lots of warnings about a "merge mismatch for summaries",
this is caused by having made changes to the source that add or remove code
that was previously run, so the new coverage output cannot sensibly be merged
into the old coverage output. You can get rid of this problem by running

    $ make clean-coverage

This deletes all the .gcda files, allowing the merge to succeed again.

The file test/gcov/expected contains the expected number of uncovered
source lines for each source and header file. Files with a number
of uncovered lines that differ (or that are not mentioned and have
non-zero uncovered lines) are reported. After checking that a file
only contains uncovered lines that cannot be reached by the tests,
you can add a suppression line the file, so "make coverage" only
alerts you if the number of uncovered lines changes.

To get a nicely formatted HTML report of the coverage, run

    $ make lcov

This creates a coverage report in build/lcov/index.html. Note that the report
contains the bogus uncovered lines that are produced by gcov.

If lcov complains about unrecognized lines lines, apply this patch
to /usr/bin/geninfo:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=590034

To run the static C++ checks:

    $ make cppcheck


Installation
------------

To get files that form part of an installation, run a "make install"
in the build directory. By default, this installs them in the "install"
subdirectory of the build directory. If you want to install into a
different directory, use

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local # Or wherever...
$ make release
$ make install
